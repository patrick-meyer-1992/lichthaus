She reports that her husband Henry and her son Peter have been eaten alive by a strong man. Talan Gwynek, an Eremite who lives in the woods with his mother, is accused of the murders and arrested. Defense attorney Kate Moore is assigned to defend him, and she comes to the police station with her investigator Eric Sarin and animal expert Gavin Flemyng to interview Talan. Unwilling police inspector Klaus Pistor is sure that Talan is the murderer but must let Kate and her team work. There is turmoil in the precinct and Talan scratches Gavin. Then they visit Talan's mother and learn that Talan has a rare disease. Further, the government wants her lands to dispose nuclear waste and her husband has recently died in a car accident. Soon Eric discloses that Mr. Gwynek's death was suspicious and Pistor was in charge of the investigation. When Kate succeeds in sending Talan to a hospital for examination, she discovers the effects of Talan's disease and is responsible for the next events.","aka":["Перевертень"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM2MDYxODE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjcxMjc3MTE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2014-08-19","actors":[{"id":"nm0176882","name":"A.J.
