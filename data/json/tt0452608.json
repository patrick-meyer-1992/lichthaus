Two-thirds of the combatants die but the winner may earn his freedom. On the day he loses his job, steelworker Jensen Ames is arrested for his wife's murder. Sent to Terminal Island, he's offered an out by the steely and manipulative Warden Hennessey - race as the popular mask-wearing (but now dead) champion, Frankenstein, or rot in prison. Jensen makes the bargain. As the three-stage race approaches, he realizes that the whole thing may be a set up - can an anonymous man behind a mask get revenge and win his release?","aka":["Death Race 3000"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTA4ODc4YTQtM2YyZS00YTgzLTgyMTAtMTg4Y2Q1YWFmZDYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR2,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2008-09-26","actors":[{"id":"nm0005458","name":"Jason Statham"},{"id":"nm0000260","name":"Joan Allen"},{"id":"nm0879085","name":"Tyrese Gibson"},{"id":"nm0574534","name":"Ian McShane"},{"id":"nm2358540","name":"Natalie Martinez"},{"id":"nm1043075","name":"Max Ryan"},{"id":"nm0164809","name":"Jason Clarke"},{"id":"nm0462735","name":"Frederick Koehler"},{"id":"nm0889846","name":"Jacob Vargas"},{"id":"nm1328749","name":"Justin Mader"},{"id":"nm0489436","name":"Robert LaSardo"},{"id":"nm0795225","name":"Robin Shou"},{"id":"nm0031162","name":"Benz Antoine"},{"id":"nm0087245","name":"Danny Blanco Hall"},{"id":"nm0666787","name":"Christian Paul"},{"id":"nm0827048","name":"Janaya Stephens"},{"id":"nm0266424","name":"John Fallon"},{"id":"nm0568846","name":"Bruce McFee"}]}
