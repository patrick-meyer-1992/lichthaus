If successful, the project would store its subjects indefinitely until they are needed most. Their first test subject - Joe Bauers - was not chosen for his superiority. Instead, he's chosen because he's the most average guy in the armed services. But scandal erupts after the experiment takes place - the base is closed, and the president denies any knowledge of the project - Unfortunately, Joe doesn't wake up in a year, he wakes up in 500 years. But during that time human evolution has taken a dramatic downturn. After waking up, Joe takes a prison-assigned IQ test and finds that he's the smartest guy alive. Awaiting a full presidential pardon if he can solve one of the country's biggest problems - the dwindling plant population, Joe races against time to solve this problem. But he alienates half the country in the process. Can he make things right and escape a rather bizarre execution?","aka":["3001"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ4MzI2ZDQtYjk3MS00ODdjLTkwN2QtOTBjYzIwM2RmNzgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2007-01-25","actors":[{"id":"nm0005561","name":"Luke Wilson"},{"id":"nm0748973","name":"Maya Rudolph"},{"id":"nm1009277","name":"Dax Shepard"},{"id":"nm0187719","name":"Terry Crews"},{"id":"nm1658749","name":"Anthony 'Citric' Campos"},{"id":"nm0379114","name":"David Herman"},{"id":"nm2381768","name":"Sonny Castillo"},{"id":"nm0563895","name":"Kevin McAfee"},{"id":"nm0615663","name":"Robert Musgrave"},{"id":"nm0564530","name":"Michael McCafferty"},{"id":"nm1740994","name":"Christopher Ryan"},{"id":"nm0519043","name":"Justin Long"},{"id":"nm1843714","name":"Heath Jones"},{"id":"nm2484722","name":"Eli Muñoz"},{"id":"nm0279209","name":"Patrick Fischler"},{"id":"nm0402405","name":"Darlene Hunt"},{"id":"nm1835809","name":"Ryan Ransdell"},{"id":"nm2368805","name":"Melissa Sweet"}]}
