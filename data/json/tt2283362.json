What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji--you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they must go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves --or they'll be stuck in the game forever, to be played by others without break.","aka":["Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ0NDhjYWItYTMxZi00NTk2LWIzNDEtOWZiYWYxZjc2MTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2017-12-20","actors":[{"id":"nm0425005","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"id":"nm2394794","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"id":"nm0366389","name":"Kevin Hart"},{"id":"nm0085312","name":"Jack Black"},{"id":"nm1055302","name":"Rhys Darby"},{"id":"nm0134072","name":"Bobby Cannavale"},{"id":"nm2679917","name":"Nick Jonas"},{"id":"nm1842974","name":"Alex Wolff"},{"id":"nm3843144","name":"Ser'Darius Blain"},{"id":"nm5589690","name":"Madison Iseman"},{"id":"nm2367353","name":"Morgan Turner"},{"id":"nm5162650","name":"Sean Buxton"},{"id":"nm6550067","name":"Mason Guccione"},{"id":"nm0385792","name":"Marin Hinkle"},{"id":"nm2111132","name":"Tracey Bonner"},{"id":"nm3296440","name":"Najah Jackson"},{"id":"nm1532327","name":"Natasha Charles Parker"},{"id":"nm8919061","name":"Kat Altman"}]}
