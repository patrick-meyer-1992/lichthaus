What happened to his pot of gold is anyone's guess. Today, the property is run by the AU Sorority House of a premiere Eco-science college. A group of students decide to spend their summer vacation turning the house into a perfect \"green\" living abode. And it would be challenging enough, without the depraved Leprechaun they unwittingly revive. Now he's back and determined to get his gold by teaching these ladies a lesson in murder. Except, they aren't having it. The women band together to find his gold and add, taking down the Leprechaun to their course load.","aka":["Leprechaun 8"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjdlNmFjZGUtNWJmMS00NzQyLTkzYmMtMjRiMmRjNjI0Zjk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2018-12-11","actors":[{"id":"nm1837588","name":"Taylor Spreitler"},{"id":"nm3345344","name":"Pepi Sonuga"},{"id":"nm4868281","name":"Sai Bennett"},{"id":"nm8479531","name":"Emily Reid"},{"id":"nm2411576","name":"Ben McGregor"},{"id":"nm2839964","name":"Oliver Llewellyn Jenkins"},{"id":"nm0392625","name":"Mark Holton"},{"id":"nm2099563","name":"Linden Porco"},{"id":"nm0997477","name":"Heather McDonald"},{"id":"nm10071311","name":"Pete Spiros"},{"id":"nm1854537","name":"Leon Clingman"}]}
