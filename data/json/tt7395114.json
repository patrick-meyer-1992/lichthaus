There's Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who can't save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrificial blood he pours on his \"prayer log.\" There's Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial killers, who troll America's highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. There's the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotte's orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right.","aka":["Vùng Đất Bị Ruồng Bỏ"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE1NmVmN2EtMjZmZC00YzAyLWE4MWEtYjY5YmExMjUxODU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2020-09-10","actors":[{"id":"nm0803889","name":"Bill Skarsgård"},{"id":"nm4043618","name":"Tom Holland"},{"id":"nm8928696","name":"Michael Banks Repeta"},{"id":"nm11709013","name":"Emilio Subercaseaux Campos"},{"id":"nm2247245","name":"Haley Bennett"},{"id":"nm0341562","name":"Kristin Griffith"},{"id":"nm1659221","name":"Sebastian Stan"},{"id":"nm2142336","name":"Riley Keough"},{"id":"nm0164809","name":"Jason Clarke"},{"id":"nm0577982","name":"Harry Melling"},{"id":"nm5765616","name":"Pokey LaFarge"},{"id":"nm7340546","name":"Eliza Scanlen"},{"id":"nm1500155","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"id":"nm0040695","name":"David Atkinson"},{"id":"nm1985859","name":"Mia Wasikowska"},{"id":"nm11920756","name":"Matthew Vaughn"},{"id":"nm11920757","name":"Billy Joe Bradshaw"},{"id":"nm0388061","name":"Douglas Hodge"}]}
