Still in love with his ex-girlfriend Nova, he spends his waking hours between pining for her and scouring the internet as a social-justice troll, cowardly leaving anonymous insults to those who post objectionable content online. Meanwhile a cyber-gang, called Skizm, is running an ultra-violent game across his city, in which violent criminals fight to the death for the entertainment of an online audience of millions. Miles feels safe and secure insulting the sick audience of this game, but soon finds himself abducted and thrust into the game, forced to fight with an insane, gun-crazed, escaped lunatic. His only tools, but also his biggest handicap, are the two huge pistols that have been literally bolted onto his hands. Initially, Miles' lifetime of running from his problems pays off as he - barely - manages to elude his seemingly unstoppable opponent, but when Nova's life is threatened unless he takes an active part in the game, he must finally stop running and overcome his fears to fight for the girl he loves.","aka":["Akimbo"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZkZTg2YmQtNDYxMy00MDE4LTlmZWItNzMwZjkyYTk3NWMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA1OTAyOTI@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2020-03-05","actors":[{"id":"nm0705356","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"id":"nm3034977","name":"Samara Weaving"},{"id":"nm0219329","name":"Ned Dennehy"},{"id":"nm6812060","name":"Natasha Liu Bordizzo"},{"id":"nm0101198","name":"Grant Bowler"},{"id":"nm1249752","name":"Edwin Wright"},{"id":"nm1498725","name":"Milo Cawthorne"},{"id":"nm4495529","name":"Mark Rowley"},{"id":"nm6906799","name":"Racheal Ofori"},{"id":"nm9045748","name":"Set Sjöstrand"},{"id":"nm1055302","name":"Rhys Darby"},{"id":"nm4501311","name":"Graham Vincent"},{"id":"nm1746521","name":"Tim Foley"},{"id":"nm2348569","name":"Richard Knowles"},{"id":"nm5058015","name":"Aaron Jackson"},{"id":"nm2715688","name":"Josh Thomson"},{"id":"nm5735256","name":"Jack Riddiford"},{"id":"nm5427256","name":"Hanako Footman"}]}
