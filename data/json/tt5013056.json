Four hundred thousand British and French soldiers are hole up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats in addition to its hard-pressed Navy to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two Royal Air Force fighter pilots, and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.","aka":["Bodega Bay"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YyZjQ0NTEtNzU5MS00NGZkLTg0MTEtYzJmMWY3MWRhZjM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDA4NzMyOA@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2017-07-21","actors":[{"id":"nm7887725","name":"Fionn Whitehead"},{"id":"nm4422686","name":"Barry Keoghan"},{"id":"nm0753314","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"id":"nm0362766","name":"Tom Hardy"},{"id":"nm4044784","name":"Damien Bonnard"},{"id":"nm2902567","name":"Aneurin Barnard"},{"id":"nm5218471","name":"Lee Armstrong"},{"id":"nm5914751","name":"James Bloor"},{"id":"nm6077951","name":"Tom Glynn-Carney"},{"id":"nm4110963","name":"Jack Lowden"},{"id":"nm3451086","name":"Luke Thompson"},{"id":"nm7754761","name":"Michel Biel"},{"id":"nm4633460","name":"Constantin Balsan"},{"id":"nm6247071","name":"Billy Howle"},{"id":"nm6682520","name":"Mikey Collins"},{"id":"nm8546558","name":"Callum Blake"},{"id":"nm7635424","name":"Dean Ridge"},{"id":"nm1225475","name":"Bobby Lockwood"}]}
