She works as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a mammoth cosmetics company on the verge of releasing a revolutionary anti-aging product. When Patience inadvertently happens upon a dark secret her employer is hiding, she finds herself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy. What happens next changes Patience forever. In a mystical twist of fate, she is transformed into a woman with the strength, speed, agility and ultra-keen senses of a cat. With her newfound prowess and feline intuition, Patience becomes Catwoman, a sleek and stealthy creature balancing on the thin line between good and bad. Like any wildcat, she's dangerous, elusive and untamed. Her adventures are complicated by a burgeoning relationship with Tom Lone, a cop who has fallen for Patience but cannot shake his fascination with the mysterious Catwoman, who appears to be responsible for a string of crime sprees plaguing the city.","aka":["Untitled 'Batman Returns' Spin-off"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MzM0NDAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY3MDYyMQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2004-08-13","actors":[{"id":"nm0000932","name":"Halle Berry"},{"id":"nm0000232","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"id":"nm0000973","name":"Benjamin Bratt"},{"id":"nm0933727","name":"Lambert Wilson"},{"id":"nm0175814","name":"Frances Conroy"},{"id":"nm0097504","name":"Alex Borstein"},{"id":"nm0557219","name":"Michael Massee"},{"id":"nm0542677","name":"Byron Mann"},{"id":"nm0808990","name":"Kim Smith"},{"id":"nm0382216","name":"Christopher Heyerdahl"},{"id":"nm0935057","name":"Peter Wingfield"},{"id":"nm1159721","name":"Berend McKenzie"},{"id":"nm1661239","name":"Chase Nelson-Murray"},{"id":"nm1661246","name":"Manny Petruzzelli"},{"id":"nm1660167","name":"Harley Reiner"},{"id":"nm0336125","name":"Ona Grauer"},{"id":"nm0134227","name":"Landy Cannon"},{"id":"nm0561562","name":"Judith Maxie"}]}
