She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics. For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden. But only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.","aka":["Kill Bin Laden"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4OTUyNzcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ1NDE3OA@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2013-01-25","actors":[{"id":"nm1567113","name":"Jessica Chastain"},{"id":"nm0249291","name":"Joel Edgerton"},{"id":"nm0695435","name":"Chris Pratt"},{"id":"nm0835016","name":"Mark Strong"},{"id":"nm0164809","name":"Jason Clarke"},{"id":"nm3024530","name":"Reda Kateb"},{"id":"nm0151419","name":"Kyle Chandler"},{"id":"nm0000383","name":"Jennifer Ehle"},{"id":"nm0674782","name":"Harold Perrineau"},{"id":"nm0834989","name":"Jeremy Strong"},{"id":"nm2849874","name":"J.J.
