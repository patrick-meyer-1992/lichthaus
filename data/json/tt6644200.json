Indeed, as this new type of invader is attracted to noise, even the slightest of sounds can be deadly; however, it's been already twelve months since the powerful monsters' first sightings, and this resilient family still stands strong. Of course, learning the rules of survival in this muted dystopia is essential; nevertheless, now, of all times, an otherwise joyous event puts in jeopardy the already fragile stability. And now, more than ever, the Abbotts must not make a sound.","aka":["Vùng Đất Câm Lặng"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MDMzNTQ0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM5NzM3NDM@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2018-04-05","actors":[{"id":"nm1289434","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"id":"nm1024677","name":"John Krasinski"},{"id":"nm8075925","name":"Millicent Simmonds"},{"id":"nm7415871","name":"Noah Jupe"},{"id":"nm9330804","name":"Cade Woodward"},{"id":"nm0751762","name":"Leon Russom"},{"id":"nm1868781","name":"Rhoda Pell"}]}
