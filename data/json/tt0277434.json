Seen through the eyes of the battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (played by Mel Gibson), we see him take command of the battalion and its preparations to go into Vietnam. We also see how the French had, years earlier, been defeated in the same area. The battle was to be the first major engagement between U.S. and N.V.A. forces in South Vietnam, and showed the use of helicopters as mobility providers and assault support aircraft.","aka":["The Lost Patrol"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk3NTc4MTktNjFmZC00ZjdjLWE0ZjgtNTM4NzdmMDBjOTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2002-03-08","actors":[{"id":"nm0000154","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"id":"nm0000656","name":"Madeleine Stowe"},{"id":"nm0001427","name":"Greg Kinnear"},{"id":"nm0000385","name":"Sam Elliott"},{"id":"nm0005098","name":"Chris Klein"},{"id":"nm0005392","name":"Keri Russell"},{"id":"nm0001608","name":"Barry Pepper"},{"id":"nm0243121","name":"Duong Don"},{"id":"nm0403652","name":"Ryan Hurst"},{"id":"nm0046768","name":"Robert Bagnell"},{"id":"nm0089456","name":"Marc Blucas"},{"id":"nm0202302","name":"Josh Daugherty"},{"id":"nm0006987","name":"Jsu Garcia"},{"id":"nm0358316","name":"Jon Hamm"},{"id":"nm0163988","name":"Clark Gregg"},{"id":"nm0004993","name":"Desmond Harrington"},{"id":"nm0380231","name":"Blake Heron"},{"id":"nm0002641","name":"Erik MacArthur"}]}
