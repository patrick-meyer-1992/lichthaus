Discovering she was an Umbrella experiment, Alice has been bio-genetically enhanced with new strengths, senses and dexterity--and she will need them. In the heart of the ravaged Raccoon City, a small group of uninfected people, including Jill Valentine, a recently demoted member of Raccoon City's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services team, and Umbrella Corporation Security Officer Carlos Oliveira, fight for their lives against swarms of Undead and the deadlier and faster Lickers. Running out of luck and resources, the group is rescued by Alice, and they begin to wage an exhilarating battle to survive and escape before the Umbrella Corporation erases its experiment from the face of the earth. Their only hope lies somewhere within Raccoon City--Dr Charles Ashford, one of the leading scientists for the Umbrella Corporation, will help Alice and the others escape the city safely--if they find his daughter. Angie Ashford became separated from her father and now hides in fear. Alice, Jill and Carlos will have to fight their way through an army of Undead to save her. All the while, a secret weapon code-named Nemesis has been experimentally altered with greater modifications than Alice and has been programmed to track and destroy them. They will need all their strengths and skills to fight the battle of their lives against the mindless evil that has infected the city and the powerful forces that unleashed it on mankind.","aka":["Resident Evil 2"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTUxMzk0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ1MDIzMw@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2004-10-08","actors":[{"id":"nm0000170","name":"Milla Jovovich"},{"id":"nm0347149","name":"Sienna Guillory"},{"id":"nm0531095","name":"Eric Mabius"},{"id":"nm0004912","name":"Oded Fehr"},{"id":"nm0470981","name":"Thomas Kretschmann"},{"id":"nm1070538","name":"Sophie Vavasseur"},{"id":"nm0012398","name":"Razaaq Adoti"},{"id":"nm0364813","name":"Jared Harris"},{"id":"nm0258402","name":"Mike Epps"},{"id":"nm0002142","name":"Sandrine Holt"},{"id":"nm0007092","name":"Matthew G.
