He is the culmination of decades of research and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.","aka":["Sát Thủ: Mật Danh 47"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc2ODU1YWYtOGU1MS00ODQ3LTg1YmUtYmRmNjZmNzNiMjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2015-08-27","actors":[{"id":"nm1670029","name":"Rupert Friend"},{"id":"nm3799669","name":"Hannah Ware"},{"id":"nm0704270","name":"Zachary Quinto"},{"id":"nm0001354","name":"Ciarán Hinds"},{"id":"nm2854802","name":"Angelababy"},{"id":"nm2045884","name":"Dan Bakkedahl"},{"id":"nm1026278","name":"Charlene Beck"},{"id":"nm1095432","name":"Michael Bornhütter"},{"id":"nm7515517","name":"Melissa Broughton"},{"id":"nm0116041","name":"Nils Brunkhorst"},{"id":"nm0143819","name":"Michaela Caspar"},{"id":"nm7515518","name":"Alvin Chan"},{"id":"nm0179349","name":"Michael Corcoran"},{"id":"nm0220162","name":"Manuel Depta"},{"id":"nm7515519","name":"Andrew DiBartolomeo"},{"id":"nm1096433","name":"Georg Ebinal"},{"id":"nm1220646","name":"Jörg Ellmer"},{"id":"nm7515520","name":"Waye Leon Goh"}]}
