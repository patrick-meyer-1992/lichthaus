Kaufman has planned the ultimate marathon of lost film prints to unleash upon his faithful cinephile patrons. Four films so rare that they have never been exhibited publicly on American soil until this very night! With titles like Wadzilla, I Was A Teenage Werebear, The Diary of Anne Frankenstein, and Zom-B-Movie, Chillerama not only celebrates the golden age of drive-in B horror shlock but also spans over four decades of cinema with something for every bad taste.","aka":["Chillerama: The Ultimate Midnight Movie!"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzZkZjZjMzUtODBkZS00OTYzLTliOGUtYjNiOTk3NjYwZTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMjk0NjI@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,6,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2013-08-13","actors":[{"id":"nm0726472","name":"Adam Rifkin"},{"id":"nm1638217","name":"Sarah Mutch"},{"id":"nm0936403","name":"Ray Wise"},{"id":"nm0005417","name":"Lin Shaye"},{"id":"nm0713389","name":"Tania Raymonde"},{"id":"nm0000616","name":"Eric Roberts"},{"id":"nm0234793","name":"Miles Dougal"},{"id":"nm2513581","name":"Owen Benjamin"},{"id":"nm0206288","name":"Tracy Dawson"},{"id":"nm4844676","name":"D.
