The radicalized children of the Nazi generation led by Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, and Gudrun Ensslin are fighting a violent war against what they perceive as the new face of fascism: American imperialism supported by the German establishment, many of whom have a Nazi past. Their aim is to create a more human society, but by employing inhuman means they not only spread terror and bloodshed; they also lose their own humanity. The man who understands them is also their hunter: Horst Herold, head of the German police force. And while he succeeds in his relentless pursuit of the young terrorists, he knows he's only dealing with the tip of the iceberg.","aka":["The Baader Meinhof Complex"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWViYjU3MGYtMTExYy00OTgzLThiZWItZTgwNDI0NDM3OWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDAyMjM2OQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2008-11-14","actors":[{"id":"nm0311476","name":"Martina Gedeck"},{"id":"nm0001953","name":"Moritz Bleibtreu"},{"id":"nm0937557","name":"Johanna Wokalek"},{"id":"nm0004486","name":"Bruno Ganz"},{"id":"nm0509583","name":"Jan Josef Liefers"},{"id":"nm0880167","name":"Nadja Uhl"},{"id":"nm0487884","name":"Alexandra Maria Lara"},{"id":"nm0272224","name":"Heino Ferch"},{"id":"nm1449783","name":"Stipe Erceg"},{"id":"nm0773134","name":"Niels-Bruno Schmidt"},{"id":"nm0452385","name":"Vinzenz Kiefer"},{"id":"nm0771713","name":"Tom Schilling"},{"id":"nm0097008","name":"Susanne Bormann"},{"id":"nm0508996","name":"Simon Licht"},{"id":"nm1386040","name":"Daniel Lommatzsch"},{"id":"nm0088935","name":"Sebastian Blomberg"},{"id":"nm0381342","name":"Hannah Herzsprung"},{"id":"nm0583143","name":"Hans Werner Meyer"}]}
