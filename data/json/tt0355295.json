For the right amount of money, the intrepid charlatans pretend to rid superstitious villages of its local ghouls or witches, until disturbing rumours about missing children in the small village of Marbaden start to spread like wildfire. Now--exposed by the French governor and Napoleon's general, Delatombe--the shameless duo of alleged paranormal fighters will have to prove their worth, and, for the first time in their entire career, do battle with a genuine malevolent force. However, can the utterly unprepared boys confront the real deal? Above all, can the Brothers Grimm clear their name?","aka":["Anh Em Nhà Grimm"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzZiNGUxZmUtYjc0ZC00YzkxLWI2MWMtNDc0MWFiNjc5NGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2005-11-04","actors":[{"id":"nm0000354","name":"Matt Damon"},{"id":"nm0005132","name":"Heath Ledger"},{"id":"nm0000899","name":"Monica Bellucci"},{"id":"nm1996295","name":"Petr Ratimec"},{"id":"nm0525656","name":"Barbora Lukesová"},{"id":"nm1391444","name":"Anna Rust"},{"id":"nm1984672","name":"Jeremy Robson"},{"id":"nm0436286","name":"Radim Kalvoda"},{"id":"nm0389384","name":"Martin Hofmann"},{"id":"nm1119179","name":"Josef Pepa Nos"},{"id":"nm1563426","name":"Harry Gilliam"},{"id":"nm0879345","name":"Miroslav Táborský"},{"id":"nm0004355","name":"Roger Ashton-Griffiths"},{"id":"nm1167094","name":"Marika Sarah Procházková"},{"id":"nm0188871","name":"Mackenzie Crook"},{"id":"nm0725956","name":"Richard Ridings"},{"id":"nm1996194","name":"Alena Jakobová"},{"id":"nm0670750","name":"Rudolf Pellar"}]}
