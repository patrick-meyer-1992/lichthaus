However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than anticipated with Trench's forces not stopping the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves.","aka":["Two Guns"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ5MTgzNDg4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAyODEzOQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,10,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2013-08-16","actors":[{"id":"nm0000243","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"id":"nm0000242","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"id":"nm1745736","name":"Paula Patton"},{"id":"nm0000200","name":"Bill Paxton"},{"id":"nm0001579","name":"Edward James Olmos"},{"id":"nm0121559","name":"Robert John Burke"},{"id":"nm0005188","name":"James Marsden"},{"id":"nm1829945","name":"Greg Sproles"},{"id":"nm0911542","name":"Fred Ward"},{"id":"nm0279209","name":"Patrick Fischler"},{"id":"nm3998145","name":"Derek Solorsano"},{"id":"nm1598758","name":"Edgar Arreola"},{"id":"nm2356797","name":"Kyle Clements"},{"id":"nm4232922","name":"Christopher Matthew Cook"},{"id":"nm1419241","name":"Tim Bell"},{"id":"nm1324884","name":"Tait Fletcher"},{"id":"nm1767737","name":"Azure Parsons"},{"id":"nm0566279","name":"John McConnell"}]}
