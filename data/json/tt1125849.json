As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.","aka":["Võ Sĩ"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjYyOTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc2MzQwMg@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2009-01-16","actors":[{"id":"nm0000620","name":"Mickey Rourke"},{"id":"nm0000673","name":"Marisa Tomei"},{"id":"nm0939697","name":"Evan Rachel Wood"},{"id":"nm0546797","name":"Mark Margolis"},{"id":"nm0058178","name":"Todd Barry"},{"id":"nm0828840","name":"Wass Stevens"},{"id":"nm0295103","name":"Judah Friedlander"},{"id":"nm0588318","name":"Ernest Miller"},{"id":"nm1827444","name":"Dylan Keith Summers"},{"id":"nm3150949","name":"Tommy Farra"},{"id":"nm2355922","name":"Mike Miller"},{"id":"nm0476040","name":"Marcia Jean Kurtz"},{"id":"nm2649720","name":"John D'Leo"},{"id":"nm0619651","name":"Ajay Naidu"},{"id":"nm0069131","name":"Gregg Bello"},{"id":"nm3152426","name":"Scott Siegel"},{"id":"nm3150523","name":"Maurizio Ferrigno"},{"id":"nm1435600","name":"Donnetta Lavinia Grays"}]}
