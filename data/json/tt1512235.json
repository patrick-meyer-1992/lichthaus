When his wife Sarah falls off the wagon and dumps him for Jacques, a drug dealer, Frank tries to get her back by reporting her kidnapped, grabbing her from Jacques' car, and wailing for her to return. After watching Christian TV and having a vision, he becomes a superhero to fight evil. He sews a costume, finds a weapon (a pipe wrench) and looks for crimes to stop. He has problems: his wrench inflicts real injury, so the cops want him for being a vigilante, his sense of boundaries is flawed, and Jacques' gang has guns. Libby, a clerk at a comic book store, becomes his sidekick, and it's time to go save Sarah. What chance do they have?","aka":["Супер"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIzMGFlMWYtYTM5Mi00OTg2LWE3YjAtYTVjODAzNTc4N2IxL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,6,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2011-06-10","actors":[{"id":"nm0933988","name":"Rainn Wilson"},{"id":"nm0680983","name":"Elliot Page"},{"id":"nm0000239","name":"Liv Tyler"},{"id":"nm0000102","name":"Kevin Bacon"},{"id":"nm0001344","name":"Gregg Henry"},{"id":"nm0740264","name":"Michael Rooker"},{"id":"nm0747420","name":"Andre Royo"},{"id":"nm0348231","name":"Sean Gunn"},{"id":"nm0002888","name":"Stephen Blackehart"},{"id":"nm3259088","name":"Don Mac"},{"id":"nm0004802","name":"Linda Cardellini"},{"id":"nm0277213","name":"Nathan Fillion"},{"id":"nm1893123","name":"Gerardo Davila"},{"id":"nm3985861","name":"Grant Goodman"},{"id":"nm1675531","name":"Paul T.
