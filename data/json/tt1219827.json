Dr. Ouelet is responsible for the development of the secret project 2571 of a full mechanical body to be connected to a human brain. She uses the brain of a young woman that lost her parents in a cyber attack as subject of a prototype. One year later, the woman is ranked Major and has joined Section 9, an anti-terrorist division commanded by Chief Daisuke Aramaki, working with agents Batou and Togusa. She needs to use a medicine to help the integration of her brain with the mechanical body and has no recollections of her previous life. When Section 9 hunts down the terrorist Kuze, Major learns the secrets about Hanka Robotics and the experiment she was subjected. Now she faces her ultimate enemy: Kuze, a criminal who has managed to hack into the brains of androids and control them.","aka":["Vỏ Bọc Ma"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJiNTI3MjItMGJiMy00YzA1LTg2MTItZmE1ZmRhOWQ0NGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTk4MTM0NQ@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2017-03-30","actors":[{"id":"nm0424060","name":"Scarlett Johansson"},{"id":"nm1561982","name":"Pilou Asbæk"},{"id":"nm0001429","name":"Takeshi Kitano"},{"id":"nm0000300","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"id":"nm0685856","name":"Michael Pitt"},{"id":"nm1977856","name":"Chin Han"},{"id":"nm7391230","name":"Danusia Samal"},{"id":"nm4410706","name":"Lasarus Ratuere"},{"id":"nm1385574","name":"Yutaka Izumihara"},{"id":"nm4476708","name":"Tawanda Manyimo"},{"id":"nm0272252","name":"Peter Ferdinando"},{"id":"nm1671512","name":"Anamaria Marinca"},{"id":"nm2989873","name":"Daniel Henshall"},{"id":"nm1397662","name":"Mana Hira Davis"},{"id":"nm8864491","name":"Erroll Anderson"},{"id":"nm3659358","name":"Kai Fung Rieck"},{"id":"nm1399271","name":"Andrew Stehlin"},{"id":"nm5208438","name":"Matthias Luafutu"}]}
