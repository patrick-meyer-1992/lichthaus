He finds himself flying the lone Christmas day mission over war-torn Bosnia. But when he talks pilot Stackhouse into flying slightly off-course to check out an interesting target, the two get shot down. Burnett is soon alone, trying to outrun a pursuing army, while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics, forcing Burnett to run far out of his way.","aka":["Đằng Sau Chiến Tuyến"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzUyOTE4MjktZmU2Ni00OWI5LWJmNGQtNDRkZGIzMjdiY2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2002-01-04","actors":[{"id":"nm0000432","name":"Gene Hackman"},{"id":"nm0005562","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"id":"nm0532683","name":"Gabriel Macht"},{"id":"nm0925916","name":"Charles Malik Whitfield"},{"id":"nm0021835","name":"Joaquim de Almeida"},{"id":"nm0001418","name":"David Keith"},{"id":"nm0472762","name":"Olek Krupa"},{"id":"nm0556343","name":"Vladimir Mashkov"},{"id":"nm0407258","name":"Marko Igonda"},{"id":"nm0687937","name":"Eyal Podell"},{"id":"nm0682762","name":"Geoff Pierson"},{"id":"nm1082609","name":"Aernout Van Lynden"},{"id":"nm0415382","name":"Sam Jaeger"},{"id":"nm0426209","name":"Shane Johnson"},{"id":"nm0935579","name":"Don Winston"},{"id":"nm0993432","name":"Elizabeth Perry"},{"id":"nm1085536","name":"Igor Hajdarhodzic"},{"id":"nm1017991","name":"Tarik Filipovic"}]}
