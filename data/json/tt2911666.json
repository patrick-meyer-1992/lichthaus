But when the arrogant Russian mob prince, Iosef Tarasov, and his men pay Wick a rather unwelcome visit to rob him of his prized 1969 Mustang and his wife's present, the legendary hitman will be forced to unearth his meticulously concealed identity. Blind with revenge, John will immediately unleash a carefully orchestrated maelstrom of destruction against the sophisticated kingpin, Viggo Tarasov, and his family, who are fully aware of his lethal capacity. Now, only blood can quench the boogeyman's thirst for retribution.","aka":["Sát Thủ John Wick"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NjA1ODgzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM2MTI4MjE@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2015-04-10","actors":[{"id":"nm0000206","name":"Keanu Reeves"},{"id":"nm0638824","name":"Michael Nyqvist"},{"id":"nm0654295","name":"Alfie Allen"},{"id":"nm0000353","name":"Willem Dafoe"},{"id":"nm0935921","name":"Dean Winters"},{"id":"nm1597316","name":"Adrianne Palicki"},{"id":"nm0055455","name":"Omer Barnea"},{"id":"nm2584861","name":"Toby Leonard Moore"},{"id":"nm0076780","name":"Daniel Bernhardt"},{"id":"nm0005256","name":"Bridget Moynahan"},{"id":"nm0000491","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"id":"nm0574534","name":"Ian McShane"},{"id":"nm2125623","name":"Bridget Regan"},{"id":"nm0714698","name":"Lance Reddick"},{"id":"nm2077124","name":"Keith Jardine"},{"id":"nm1324884","name":"Tait Fletcher"},{"id":"nm3522652","name":"Kazy Tauginas"},{"id":"nm6223216","name":"Alexander Frekey"}]}
