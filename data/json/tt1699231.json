Meanwhile, the flight attendants of Trans Sky Air, Jenny and Paula, are welcoming the passengers of flight TS Air 318 from Los Angeles to Kansas City with Captain Forrest and Co-Pilot Wilsy. Teacher Henry brings a cage of hamsters to the cabin, but Jenny tells him that it should be transported in the cargo hold. However, one hamster bites the fingertip of the fat passenger Ralph. Soon, Ralph vomits and becomes aggressive, attacking Paula. The male passengers help Jenny and lock Ralph in the bathroom while Captain Forrest requests an emergency landing. When they land in the airport, they find all the gates closed and the Captain heads the plane to an abandoned terminal. Employee Ed helps the crew and passengers to reach the exit, but they find that they are closed. Soon they discover that the place is in quarantine and there is no way out.","aka":["Карантин 2: Термінал"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MDMxODUxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk4Mjk0Ng@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2011-06-17","actors":[{"id":"nm1997689","name":"Mercedes Mason"},{"id":"nm1622615","name":"Josh Cooke"},{"id":"nm4001975","name":"Mattie Liptak"},{"id":"nm1579445","name":"Ignacio Serricchio"},{"id":"nm2713973","name":"Noree Victoria"},{"id":"nm0086205","name":"Bre Blair"},{"id":"nm2690109","name":"Lamar Stewart"},{"id":"nm1197104","name":"George Back"},{"id":"nm0222883","name":"Phillip DeVona"},{"id":"nm0673536","name":"Julie Gribble"},{"id":"nm1440416","name":"Erin Áine"},{"id":"nm1931478","name":"Lynn Cole"},{"id":"nm0861123","name":"Tom Thon"},{"id":"nm0480808","name":"Sandra Ellis Lafferty"},{"id":"nm4002294","name":"Tyler Kunkle"},{"id":"nm1491348","name":"John Curran"},{"id":"nm0070235","name":"Andrew Benator"},{"id":"nm2398956","name":"Jason Benjamin"}]}
