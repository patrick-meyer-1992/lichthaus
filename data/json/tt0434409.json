She is an employee of the state-run British Television Network, but soon, she becomes the number one enemy of the state together with an enigmatic and larger-than-life freedom fighter known only by the letter \"V\". V informs Evey that she must hide in his underground lair for at least one year, and while she is reluctant to the idea at first, a bond soon forms between the two individuals. In the meanwhile, the mysterious past of V is gradually revealed to the police inspector tasked with capturing him, Eric Finch, and it is not long until he starts questioning everything his government stands for.","aka":["V for Vendetta: The IMAX Experience"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI5ODc3NzExNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxNzQzMw@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2006-03-17","actors":[{"id":"nm0915989","name":"Hugo Weaving"},{"id":"nm0000204","name":"Natalie Portman"},{"id":"nm0001291","name":"Rupert Graves"},{"id":"nm0001653","name":"Stephen Rea"},{"id":"nm0000410","name":"Stephen Fry"},{"id":"nm0000457","name":"John Hurt"},{"id":"nm0683116","name":"Tim Pigott-Smith"},{"id":"nm0019885","name":"Roger Allam"},{"id":"nm0587060","name":"Ben Miles"},{"id":"nm0193661","name":"Sinéad Cusack"},{"id":"nm0927846","name":"Natasha Wightman"},{"id":"nm0822062","name":"John Standing"},{"id":"nm0550371","name":"Eddie Marsan"},{"id":"nm1599755","name":"Clive Ashborn"},{"id":"nm0276074","name":"Emma Field-Rayner"},{"id":"nm0121090","name":"Ian Burfield"},{"id":"nm2147779","name":"Mark Phoenix"},{"id":"nm0563689","name":"Alister Mazzotti"}]}
