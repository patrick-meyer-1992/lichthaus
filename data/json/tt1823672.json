The former military Vincent Moore is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot.","aka":["Chappie: Cảnh Sát Người Máy"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNTI4NTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ4MTI0NDE@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2015-03-06","actors":[{"id":"nm1663205","name":"Sharlto Copley"},{"id":"nm2353862","name":"Dev Patel"},{"id":"nm0413168","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"id":"nm0000244","name":"Sigourney Weaver"},{"id":"nm4375135","name":"Ninja"},{"id":"nm4375497","name":"Yo-Landi Visser"},{"id":"nm1504678","name":"Jose Pablo Cantillo"},{"id":"nm1409827","name":"Brandon Auret"},{"id":"nm3520514","name":"Johnny Selema"},{"id":"nm0177846","name":"Anderson Cooper"},{"id":"nm2820701","name":"Maurice Carpede"},{"id":"nm2271261","name":"Jason Cope"},{"id":"nm0653268","name":"Kevin Otto"},{"id":"nm1528483","name":"Chris Shields"},{"id":"nm1042930","name":"Bill Marchant"},{"id":"nm1193091","name":"Robert Hobbs"},{"id":"nm7157338","name":"Mark K.
