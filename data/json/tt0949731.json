It's about the sudden, mysterious disappearance of bees. Yet again Nature is doing something inexplicable, and whatever science has to say about it will be, in the end, only a theory. Scientists will bring out more theories, but no explanations, when a more urgent dilemma hits the planet. It begins in Central Park. Suddenly and inexplicably, the behavior of everyone in the park changes in a most bizarre and horrible way. Soon, the strange behavior spreads throughout the city and beyond. Elliot, his wife, Alma, and Jess, the young daughter of a friend, will only have theories to guide them where to run and where to hide. But theories may not be enough.","aka":["Green Planet"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MjcwNjI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM4NjM3MQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2008-06-13","actors":[{"id":"nm0000242","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"id":"nm0221046","name":"Zooey Deschanel"},{"id":"nm0000491","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"id":"nm1496319","name":"Ashlyn Sanchez"},{"id":"nm0000990","name":"Betty Buckley"},{"id":"nm0107748","name":"Spencer Breslin"},{"id":"nm0047121","name":"Robert Bailey Jr."},{"id":"nm0172806","name":"Frank Collison"},{"id":"nm0834989","name":"Jeremy Strong"},{"id":"nm0001688","name":"Alan Ruck"},{"id":"nm0164594","name":"Victoria Clark"},{"id":"nm0796117","name":"M.
