Some time later, Amanda arrives at the home of the more popular and academically-inclined Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy). The girls had previously been best friends but grew apart after the death of Lily's father. They meet under the pretense of hanging out and having a casual tutoring session, but Amanda knows that her mother (Kaili Vernoff) has paid Lily to socialize with Amanda.

Lily meets with Amanda again, this time voluntarily, and they rekindle their friendship..","aka":["Thoroughbred"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczOTIxNDMxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk5OTg4NDM@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2018-04-06","actors":[{"id":"nm4972453","name":"Olivia Cooke"},{"id":"nm5896355","name":"Anya Taylor-Joy"},{"id":"nm0947338","name":"Anton Yelchin"},{"id":"nm0817027","name":"Paul Sparks"},{"id":"nm0842587","name":"Francie Swift"},{"id":"nm0894627","name":"Kaili Vernoff"},{"id":"nm4937710","name":"Svetlana Orlova"},{"id":"nm9252846","name":"Alyssa Fishenden"},{"id":"nm8578252","name":"Jackson Damon"},{"id":"nm7344386","name":"James Haddad"},{"id":"nm3101371","name":"Nolan Ball"},{"id":"nm0646496","name":"Celeste Oliva"},{"id":"nm7111681","name":"Kristen Annese"},{"id":"nm3241158","name":"Stephanie Atkinson"},{"id":"nm9792589","name":"Jason Beckett"},{"id":"nm10839268","name":"Chhoyang Cheshatsang"},{"id":"nm3578012","name":"Xavier Dillingham"},{"id":"nm12365951","name":"James Lawyer"}]}
