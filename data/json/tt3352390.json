She graciously accepts social outcast Marina's (Liesl Ahlers) online friend request, until Marina crosses the line and Laura unfriends her. To everyone's shock, Marina takes her own life in a ritual meant to torment Laura, which appears in a video posted on Laura's profile. Even though it wasn't Laura who posted the video, or other creepy content that begins appearing on her page, her Facebook friend count begins to dwindle as a result. When her real-life friends start dying mysterious, cruel deaths, Laura must figure out how to break the deadly curse before it's too late.","aka":["Kill a Friend"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFhZjQ5OTEtY2FlMy00OWM5LTlkYjAtZGUyNTE2YmVkYjc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjkwMzU3NDI@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2016-04-22","actors":[{"id":"nm1486317","name":"Alycia Debnam-Carey"},{"id":"nm0608440","name":"William Moseley"},{"id":"nm1269733","name":"Connor Paolo"},{"id":"nm2694584","name":"Brit Morgan"},{"id":"nm6964082","name":"Brooke Markham"},{"id":"nm0549826","name":"Sean Marquette"},{"id":"nm5553616","name":"Liesl Ahlers"},{"id":"nm0356101","name":"Shashawnee Hall"},{"id":"nm0199447","name":"Susan Danford"},{"id":"nm5953245","name":"Lee Raviv"},{"id":"nm2322286","name":"Nicholas Pauling"},{"id":"nm0124880","name":"David Butler"},{"id":"nm6964087","name":"Julian Katz"},{"id":"nm6964088","name":"Kiano Janse van Rensburg"},{"id":"nm0332366","name":"Dorothy Ann Gould"},{"id":"nm0823216","name":"Kimberleigh Stark"},{"id":"nm6964089","name":"Wendy Acton Burnell"},{"id":"nm6964086","name":"Julie Summers"}]}
