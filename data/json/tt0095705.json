(1982). An Airplane! (1980)-type spoof, this time with the an incompetent Lieutenant Frank Drebin, who always \"gets his man\". Visual gags come thick and fast, and it's impossible to catch them all with one viewing. The plot: Queen Elizabeth II of England is coming to town, and Vincent Ludwig has plans to assassinate her using a brainwashed baseball player.","aka":["The Naked Gun"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1ZWM4ZjItMjFhZi00MDMxLTgxNmYtODFhNWZlZTkwM2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,9,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"1989-02-17","actors":[{"id":"nm0000558","name":"Leslie Nielsen"},{"id":"nm0001636","name":"Priscilla Presley"},{"id":"nm0001740","name":"O.J.
