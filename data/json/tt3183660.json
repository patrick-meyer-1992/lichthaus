Amid an already fragile equilibrium of secrecy, and the increasing disasters ascribed to the dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, Newt's precious suitcase goes missing, and to make matters worse, several creatures manage to escape. Before long, this unforeseen complication catches Senior Auror Percival Graves' attention who targets Newt, against the backdrop of an invisible, devastating, and utterly unpredictable menace that still wreaks havoc on 5th Avenue. In the end, is there a hidden agenda behind Graves' intentions? Moreover, what will happen to the remaining fantastic beasts that are still on the loose?","aka":["Sinh Vật Huyền Bí và Nơi Tìm Ra Chúng"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxOTM1OTI4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5OTYxMDI@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2016-11-18","actors":[{"id":"nm1519666","name":"Eddie Redmayne"},{"id":"nm2239702","name":"Katherine Waterston"},{"id":"nm0837223","name":"Alison Sudol"},{"id":"nm0283945","name":"Dan Fogler"},{"id":"nm0714866","name":"Sam Redford"},{"id":"nm2580832","name":"Scott Goldman"},{"id":"nm0072758","name":"Tim Bentinck"},{"id":"nm0846925","name":"Tristan Tait"},{"id":"nm0268199","name":"Colin Farrell"},{"id":"nm0384732","name":"Tom Clarke Hill"},{"id":"nm0799252","name":"Matthew Sim"},{"id":"nm0608090","name":"Samantha Morton"},{"id":"nm3009232","name":"Ezra Miller"},{"id":"nm7500671","name":"Faith Wood-Blagrove"},{"id":"nm2893183","name":"Jenn Murray"},{"id":"nm3270798","name":"Cory Peterson"},{"id":"nm0688351","name":"Lucie Pohl"},{"id":"nm0106998","name":"Peter Breitmayer"}]}
