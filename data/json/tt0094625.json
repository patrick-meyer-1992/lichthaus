Shotaro Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang. His friend Tetsuo is injured in an accident and taken to a top-secret government facility. He develops telekinetic powers but decides to use them for evil rather than good. He has the same powers as Akira, the force that destroyed Tokyo in 1988, and now it appears that history will repeat itself.","aka":["Akira: The Special Edition"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZiZTk1ODgtMTZkNS00NTYxLWIxZTUtNWExZGYwZTRjODViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE2MzA3MDM@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"1988-07-16","actors":[{"id":"nm0412628","name":"Mitsuo Iwata"},{"id":"nm0765815","name":"Nozomu Sasaki"},{"id":"nm0468708","name":"Mami Koyama"},{"id":"nm0312656","name":"Tesshô Genda"},{"id":"nm0960022","name":"Hiroshi Ôtake"},{"id":"nm0457561","name":"Kôichi Kitamura"},{"id":"nm0407495","name":"Michihiro Ikemizu"},{"id":"nm0297167","name":"Yuriko Fuchizaki"},{"id":"nm0959991","name":"Masaaki Ôkura"},{"id":"nm0032875","name":"Tarô Arakawa"},{"id":"nm0476223","name":"Takeshi Kusao"},{"id":"nm0849003","name":"Kazumi Tanaka"},{"id":"nm0441971","name":"Masayuki Katô"},{"id":"nm0015342","name":"Yôsuke Akimoto"},{"id":"nm0386252","name":"Masato Hirano"},{"id":"nm0457238","name":"Yukimasa Kishino"},{"id":"nm0436635","name":"Kazuhiro Kandô"},{"id":"nm0620242","name":"Tatsuhiko Nakamura"}]}
