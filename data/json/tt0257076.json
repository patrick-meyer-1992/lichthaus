Although they thwarted the robbery, they shot a hostage in the process. Street was suspended from S.W.A.T. while Gamble was fired altogether. After 6 months, a veteran S.W.A.T. officer, Daniel Harrelson or \"Hondo\", is told to assemble a S.W.A.T. team for his division. He chooses other S.W.A.T. officers as well as 3 rookies. However, after they pass the S.W.A.T. training, they receive a message that a French crime boss, known as Alex Montell is trying to escape from prison. This will not be easy to prevent, especially after Montell promises $100 Million to his rescuers.","aka":["S.W.A.T. - Unidad especial"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIxYTVmMDEtNWU5NS00MWJhLWJjNmQtNjkxNWI3NmY4MzJlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,7,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2003-12-05","actors":[{"id":"nm0000168","name":"Samuel L.
