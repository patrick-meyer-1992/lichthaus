War has raged between the two for as long as most can remember. King Regis of Lucis commands an elite force of soldiers dubbed the Kingsglaive. Wielding their king's magic, Nyx Ulric and his fellow glaives stand before the crown city of Insomnia, fighting to stay the inexorable advance of Niflheim's imperial army. Before the overwhelming military might of the empire, King Regis can only salvage his kingdom by accepting an ultimatum-he must cede all lands outside the crown city, and see his son, Prince Noctis, wed to Lady Lunafreya, the former princess of Tenebrae now captive of Niflheim. As the war of wills rages, the machinations of Niflheim transform Insomnia into an awe-inspiring battleground, pulling Nyx into a struggle for the very survival of the kingdom.","aka":["Final Fantasy XV: Đội Vệ Binh Tinh Nhuệ"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEwNzMxNTU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzMyMjg3OTE@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2016-07-09","actors":[{"id":"nm0666739","name":"Aaron Paul"},{"id":"nm0372176","name":"Lena Headey"},{"id":"nm0000293","name":"Sean Bean"},{"id":"nm0627667","name":"Neil Newbon"},{"id":"nm1345685","name":"Adrian Bouchet"},{"id":"nm7377748","name":"Liam Mulvey"},{"id":"nm3524964","name":"Alexa Kahn"},{"id":"nm1920556","name":"Todd Haberkorn"},{"id":"nm0218555","name":"John DeMita"},{"id":"nm0304564","name":"David Gant"},{"id":"nm0210875","name":"Darin De Paul"},{"id":"nm0222175","name":"Trevor Devall"},{"id":"nm0228356","name":"Ben Diskin"},{"id":"nm5489754","name":"Max Mittelman"},{"id":"nm0990122","name":"Will Bowden"},{"id":"nm0283253","name":"Wendee Lee"},{"id":"nm4251381","name":"Hyrum Hansen"},{"id":"nm8582854","name":"Liliana Chomsky"}]}
