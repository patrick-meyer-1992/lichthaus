    "description": "Over 4 years of lock-down in LA in 2024 and COVID-23 has mutated and has a 56% mortality rate. Only the few immune people can leave their homes. Nico is one of the few. He's a courier delivering packages on his bike. He has the LA streets to himself except a few checkpoints. People hate him as he's immune and can move around and they can't. He has a cute girlfriend but all communication is over cellphones. LA's Department of Sanitation forcefully collects infected people and their non-immune household members from their homes to take them to quarantine zones. Q zones are thought of as quick death zones.",
