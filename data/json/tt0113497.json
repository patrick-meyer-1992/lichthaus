Mysterious and magical, the game strands the unsuspecting boy in the lush, savage forests of a mythical realm. Nearly three decades later, the game releases him before the awed eyes of the young orphaned siblings, Judy and Peter Shepherd. Now, the wild and incessant beat of the jungle's tribal drums is calling for the now-adult Alan and the other hesitant players, as the one who rolls the dice must never leave undone what the roll has started. Has anyone ever escaped from the game and Jumanji's formidable foes?","aka":["Jumanji: Trò Chơi Bí Ẩn"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk2ZmUwYmEtNTcwZS00YmMyLWFkYjMtNTRmZDA3YWExMjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"1996-02-16","actors":[{"id":"nm0000245","name":"Robin Williams"},{"id":"nm0000379","name":"Kirsten Dunst"},{"id":"nm0001372","name":"Bonnie Hunt"},{"id":"nm0404993","name":"Jonathan Hyde"},{"id":"nm0682300","name":"Bradley Pierce"},{"id":"nm0001564","name":"Bebe Neuwirth"},{"id":"nm0004979","name":"David Alan Grier"},{"id":"nm0165101","name":"Patricia Clarkson"},{"id":"nm0002123","name":"Adam Hann-Byrd"},{"id":"nm0120410","name":"Laura Bell Bundy"},{"id":"nm0359695","name":"James Handy"},{"id":"nm0053390","name":"Gillian Barber"},{"id":"nm0643488","name":"Brandon Obray"},{"id":"nm0857326","name":"Cyrus Thiedeke"},{"id":"nm0861809","name":"Gary Joseph Thorup"},{"id":"nm0957648","name":"Leonard Zola"},{"id":"nm0077615","name":"Lloyd Berry"},{"id":"nm0829121","name":"Malcolm Stewart"}]}
