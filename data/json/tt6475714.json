There, trapped in a barren desert-world rife with formidable adversaries and subterranean sand-dwelling beasts, for the first time, Captain Artemis and her squad are shocked to discover that their otherwise destructive military weapons are now entirely inadequate to take down the enemy. But, unexpectedly, in their desperate battle for survival, the team stumbles upon a mysterious local huntsman whose superior combat skills allow him to stay one step ahead of the mighty creatures. Is there an escape from the prison realm? Above all, what does it take to become a fearless monster hunter?","aka":["Thợ Săn Quái Vật"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU3NTFmNjYtODc3Ny00MWEzLWI3M2ItZjE3NDgwMTI0MzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMjM2NDc2._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2021-06-18","actors":[{"id":"nm0000170","name":"Milla Jovovich"},{"id":"nm1388074","name":"Tony Jaa"},{"id":"nm0000579","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"id":"nm1939267","name":"T.I."},{"id":"nm1546300","name":"Diego Boneta"},{"id":"nm0328709","name":"Meagan Good"},{"id":"nm2890541","name":"Josh Helman"},{"id":"nm1265149","name":"Jin Au-Yeung"},{"id":"nm5193462","name":"Hirona Yamazaki"},{"id":"nm2583479","name":"Jannik Schümann"},{"id":"nm2273474","name":"Nanda Costa"},{"id":"nm3797176","name":"Nic Rasenti"},{"id":"nm1794534","name":"Clyde Berning"},{"id":"nm2518215","name":"Paul Hampshire"},{"id":"nm7988295","name":"Schelaine Bennett"},{"id":"nm0288230","name":"Bart Fouche"},{"id":"nm2796811","name":"Pope Jerrod"},{"id":"nm2371323","name":"Aaron Beelner"}]}
