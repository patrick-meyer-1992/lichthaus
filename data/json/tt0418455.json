He's odd: seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, in denial about personal facts, and convinced he's at war with Satan. The rectory is a halfway house for recently-paroled convicts. Adam arrives for 12 weeks, a large, tough neo-Nazi, first baffled by Ivan's thick-headed optimism, then angry. He vows to break Ivan's faith. Meanwhile, in exasperation at Ivan's insistence, Adam sets a personal goal: to bake an apple pie. All goes awry for the tree: crows, worms, lightning. The Book of Job gives Adam perverse insight, and his hooligan mates provide the resolution.","aka":["Adam's Apples"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NTc5NjM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyMTE0MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2005-04-15","actors":[{"id":"nm0860947","name":"Ulrich Thomsen"},{"id":"nm0586568","name":"Mads Mikkelsen"},{"id":"nm0110334","name":"Nicolas Bro"},{"id":"nm0824785","name":"Paprika Steen"},{"id":"nm0443671","name":"Ali Kazim"},{"id":"nm0857663","name":"Ole Thestrup"},{"id":"nm0509263","name":"Nikolaj Lie Kaas"},{"id":"nm0530612","name":"Gyrd Løfquist"},{"id":"nm1046521","name":"Lars Ranthe"},{"id":"nm0717085","name":"Peter Reichhardt"},{"id":"nm0421716","name":"Tomas Villum Jensen"},{"id":"nm0483282","name":"Peter Lambert"},{"id":"nm2575664","name":"Solvej K.
