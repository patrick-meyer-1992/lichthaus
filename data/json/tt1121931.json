He's in an unknown location, sedated, while various Chinese are harvesting his organs. His heart is gone, in an ice chest; a temporary in its place. Chev escapes, knowing only the name of the guy with the ice chest. He calls Doc Miles, an unlicensed cardiologist, who tells him there's only an hour's life in the artificial heart: keep it charged. Chev needs to find his own heart and get to Doc for a transplant. He starts his time-limited pursuit of shadowy figures, the ice chest, and his heart aided by Eve, Rei, and Venus - a stripper, a prostitute, and a pal with Tourette's - constantly needing an electric charge to keep going.","aka":["Crank 2: High Voltage"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNTU1ODkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgyODEzMg@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,6,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2009-04-16","actors":[{"id":"nm0005458","name":"Jason Statham"},{"id":"nm0005442","name":"Amy Smart"},{"id":"nm0004286","name":"Clifton Collins Jr."},{"id":"nm0948267","name":"Dwight Yoakam"},{"id":"nm0708293","name":"Efren Ramirez"},{"id":"nm1549602","name":"Julanne Chidi Hill"},{"id":"nm1504678","name":"Jose Pablo Cantillo"},{"id":"nm0934008","name":"Reno Wilson"},{"id":"nm0949775","name":"Keone Young"},{"id":"nm2542282","name":"Art Hsu"},{"id":"nm1928515","name":"Joseph Julian Soria"},{"id":"nm0000499","name":"Bai Ling"},{"id":"nm0001016","name":"David Carradine"},{"id":"nm0000433","name":"Corey Haim"},{"id":"nm0001312","name":"Geri Horner"},{"id":"nm2598945","name":"William Brent"},{"id":"nm0364807","name":"Jamie Harris"},{"id":"nm0209496","name":"John de Lancie"}]}
