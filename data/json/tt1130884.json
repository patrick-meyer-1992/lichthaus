He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.","aka":["Ashecliffe"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhiNDkyNzktNTZmYS00ZTBkLTk2MDAtM2U0YjU1MzgxZjgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2010-03-12","actors":[{"id":"nm0000138","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"id":"nm0607865","name":"Emily Mortimer"},{"id":"nm0749263","name":"Mark Ruffalo"},{"id":"nm0001426","name":"Ben Kingsley"},{"id":"nm0001884","name":"Max von Sydow"},{"id":"nm0931329","name":"Michelle Williams"},{"id":"nm0165101","name":"Patricia Clarkson"},{"id":"nm0355097","name":"Jackie Earle Haley"},{"id":"nm0505971","name":"Ted Levine"},{"id":"nm0002253","name":"John Carroll Lynch"},{"id":"nm0000480","name":"Elias Koteas"},{"id":"nm0000862","name":"Robin Bartlett"},{"id":"nm1706832","name":"Christopher Denham"},{"id":"nm0778533","name":"Nellie Sciutto"},{"id":"nm0797746","name":"Joseph Sikora"},{"id":"nm1478007","name":"Curtiss Cook"},{"id":"nm0859403","name":"Raymond Anthony Thomas"},{"id":"nm0571375","name":"Joseph McKenna"}]}
