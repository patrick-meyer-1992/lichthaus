And yet they've got to win the annual maneuver against the crack GIs from the neighboring US base .","aka":["Military Academy"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMTI1ODk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ3NzU4MQ@@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2007-08-30","actors":[{"id":"nm1307343","name":"Franz Dinda"},{"id":"nm0525518","name":"Florian Lukas"},{"id":"nm0825398","name":"Axel Stein"},{"id":"nm2395653","name":"Kailas Mahadevan"},{"id":"nm1923675","name":"Christian Sengewald"},{"id":"nm1877891","name":"Till Trenkel"},{"id":"nm0509461","name":"Oona-Devi Liebich"},{"id":"nm0633015","name":"Ronald Nitschke"},{"id":"nm0635297","name":"Carsten Norgaard"},{"id":"nm1083116","name":"Jan Henrik Stahlberg"},{"id":"nm2634861","name":"Maren Scheel"},{"id":"nm0104710","name":"Michael Brandner"},{"id":"nm2577859","name":"Michael Dorn"},{"id":"nm1350752","name":"Jean-Luc Julien"},{"id":"nm0470159","name":"Sonya Kraus"},{"id":"nm1561615","name":"Arne Lenk"},{"id":"nm2912545","name":"Maximilian Löwenstein"},{"id":"nm0530760","name":"Joseph M'Barek"}]}
