After conspicuous acts of gallantry Airman William H Pitsenbarger was killed in Vietnam in 1966. He was recommended for the MoH but his award was downgraded to the Air Force Cross. For over 30 years his comrades and family have been lobbying for him to receive the medal. Huffman cares more about his own career than this case but the more he looks into it, the more convinced he is that Pitsenbarger deserves the MoH and should have received it in 1966. Why didn't he then?","aka":["Một Cách Vẹn Toàn"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUxNGU1MGYtMTkzNS00ZGFkLTkwZDYtZTc4NDgwNjdmYjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY1MzQyNDk@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"2020-01-24","actors":[{"id":"nm1659221","name":"Sebastian Stan"},{"id":"nm0837223","name":"Alison Sudol"},{"id":"nm8313926","name":"Asher Miles Fallica"},{"id":"nm0004986","name":"LisaGay Hamilton"},{"id":"nm0925966","name":"Bradley Whitford"},{"id":"nm0000458","name":"William Hurt"},{"id":"nm0730070","name":"Linus Roache"},{"id":"nm3528539","name":"Jeremy Irvine"},{"id":"nm5478558","name":"Eoin O'Brien"},{"id":"nm0001626","name":"Christopher Plummer"},{"id":"nm0002663","name":"Diane Ladd"},{"id":"nm0000168","name":"Samuel L.
