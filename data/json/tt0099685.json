His two partners could kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to think about climbing up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, might be badly affected by his partners' success, but will he consider stooping low enough to bring about the downfall of Jimmy and Tommy?","aka":["Good Fellas"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NkZjEzMDgtN2RjYy00YzM1LWI4ZmQtMjIwYjFjNmI3ZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,2,190,281_.jpg","imdb_date":"1990-11-23","actors":[{"id":"nm0000134","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"id":"nm0000501","name":"Ray Liotta"},{"id":"nm0000582","name":"Joe Pesci"},{"id":"nm0000966","name":"Lorraine Bracco"},{"id":"nm0000649","name":"Paul Sorvino"},{"id":"nm0803370","name":"Frank Sivero"},{"id":"nm0201700","name":"Tony Darrow"},{"id":"nm0823563","name":"Mike Starr"},{"id":"nm0898634","name":"Frank Vincent"},{"id":"nm0522797","name":"Chuck Low"},{"id":"nm0226746","name":"Frank DiLeo"},{"id":"nm0950267","name":"Henny Youngman"},{"id":"nm0557848","name":"Gina Mastrogiacomo"},{"id":"nm0778734","name":"Catherine Scorsese"},{"id":"nm0778737","name":"Charles Scorsese"},{"id":"nm0791877","name":"Suzanne Shepherd"},{"id":"nm0000529","name":"Debi Mazar"},{"id":"nm0935247","name":"Margo Winkler"}]}
