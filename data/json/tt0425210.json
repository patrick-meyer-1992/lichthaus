In Manhattan, two bookies and the son of a Mob boss die. A young man just out of the shower answers the door to a neighbor woman and explains that he's visiting, has had a bad week, including being mugged, and doesn't know where his pal, who lives there, is. The neighbor is chatty; she's a coroner. Two thugs arrive and, believing the visitor to be the guy who lives there, take him to see the boss with the dead son, who tells him to kill the son of his Mob rival. Mistaken identity? What connects the threads? Cops are watching.","aka":["Lucky # Slevin"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjczMWI1YWMtYTZjOS00ZDc5LWE2MWItMTY3ZGUxNzFkNjJmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2006-02-24","actors":[{"id":"nm0001326","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"id":"nm0001426","name":"Ben Kingsley"},{"id":"nm0000151","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"id":"nm0005154","name":"Lucy Liu"},{"id":"nm0000246","name":"Bruce Willis"},{"id":"nm1032371","name":"Michael Rubenfeld"},{"id":"nm0653660","name":"Peter Outerbridge"},{"id":"nm0001804","name":"Stanley Tucci"},{"id":"nm0150255","name":"Kevin Chamberlin"},{"id":"nm0592923","name":"Dorian Missick"},{"id":"nm0932112","name":"Mykelti Williamson"},{"id":"nm0317181","name":"Scott Gibson"},{"id":"nm0440511","name":"Daniel Kash"},{"id":"nm0155726","name":"Dmitry Chepovetsky"},{"id":"nm0415382","name":"Sam Jaeger"},{"id":"nm0000732","name":"Danny Aiello"},{"id":"nm1503655","name":"Oliver Davis"},{"id":"nm1015684","name":"Corey Stoll"}]}
