Irwin quickly butts heads with the facility's autocratic warden, Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), who runs his command with an iron fist, even killing prisoners when he deems it necessary. Irwin rallies his fellow convicts into a rag-tag army and leads them in a revolt against Winter, an action that the warden is ready to repel by violent means.","aka":["The Castle"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzZlMTllYjMtZmQ0NS00ZGJkLTg1ODItODM2MmViYjlmNzcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR2,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2002-01-04","actors":[{"id":"nm0000602","name":"Robert Redford"},{"id":"nm0001254","name":"James Gandolfini"},{"id":"nm0749263","name":"Mark Ruffalo"},{"id":"nm0123733","name":"Steve Burton"},{"id":"nm0005148","name":"Delroy Lindo"},{"id":"nm0129538","name":"Paul Calderon"},{"id":"nm0050458","name":"Sam Ball"},{"id":"nm1003874","name":"Jeremy Childs"},{"id":"nm0004286","name":"Clifton Collins Jr."},{"id":"nm0779187","name":"George W.
