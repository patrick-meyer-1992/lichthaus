While fighting with and feeding on a human scavenger party, R meets Julie and feels an urge to protect her. What happens next is the beginning of a strangely warm relationship that allows R to begin regaining his humanity. As this change spreads through the local undead population like a virus, Julie and R eventually have to face a larger issue when the very nature of their friendship is challenged. Caught between the paranoid human forces and the ferocious \"Bonies\", zombies who are a mutual threat, R and Julie must find a way to bridge the differences of each side to fight for a better world no one thought possible.","aka":["Tình Yêu Zombie"],"version":2,"image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc5ZjFhMDItYmViMi00YjI5LTgzNzctZjcxMDYzMWU2NTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR5,0,190,281_FMwebp.webp","imdb_date":"2013-02-08","actors":[{"id":"nm0396558","name":"Nicholas Hoult"},{"id":"nm1954240","name":"Teresa Palmer"},{"id":"nm0000518","name":"John Malkovich"},{"id":"nm3006818","name":"Lio Tipton"},{"id":"nm1117791","name":"Rob Corddry"},{"id":"nm2002649","name":"Dave Franco"},{"id":"nm0362484","name":"Cory Hardrict"},{"id":"nm1532833","name":"Daniel Rindress-Kay"},{"id":"nm1296188","name":"Vincent Leclerc"},{"id":"nm5476023","name":"Clifford LeDuc-Vaillancourt"},{"id":"nm1662361","name":"Billie Calmeau"},{"id":"nm5475841","name":"Adam Driscoll"},{"id":"nm3809782","name":"Chris Cavener"},{"id":"nm2393063","name":"Jonathan Dubsky"},{"id":"nm5475816","name":"Alec Bourgeois"},{"id":"nm1952213","name":"Robert Reynolds"},{"id":"nm4712900","name":"Felix Bergeron"},{"id":"nm0492124","name":"Josée Laviolette"}]}
